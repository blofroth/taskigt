# Taskigt - hierarchical planning and note taking

A structured text format for simple hierarchical (tree based) note taking and planning. And a web interface to edit
and persist documents locally.

Philosophies:
* Function over form
* Everything is a tree
* Should be perfectly readable also as a text document
